0.7.3 (2020-05-11)

- Add a tab to the inventory displaying statistics for all owned colonies, with the following data
-- Calories, Happiness, Idle time (ms/s), Stockpile, Inbound Trade, Outbound Trade, misc Colony
-- 1-, 4- and 24-days worth of data

- Changed search filter for the stockpile (also used for the statistics search field), with these options:
-- sometext "some text" 'some text' -> match type name
-- 123 -> match type index
-- >100 <100 -> match amount above/below a certain amount
-- cat:food cat:"food" cat:'food' -> match item category
-- is:food is:luxury -> match item properties
- Added some prefab filter buttons to the stockpile to showcase above thing

- Taught the client about the existence of multiple colonies in a world;
-- Adds support for rendering safe zones for all owned colonies at once (before it was only the active colony)
-- Probably misc fixes related to this

- Added a slight contrast between day & night guard outline block color
- Added "/time day" cheaty command, to skip to the next sunrise
- Added "/time night" cheaty command, to skip to the next sunset
- Default mods to disabled for new worlds unless the mod opts into default on (was the other way around)
- Removed berry bush production from berry farmers (only decorative uses by the player, and can be bought from the shop)

Bug fixies:
- Fix a problem with unremovable blocks if it's a no-longer-registered type with the last registered index
- Fix edge case in disconnecting people in multiplayer that could freeze network communications
- Fix "failed to find npc ID xyz" warning never resetting (clear the ref and re-save the chunk)
- Fix auto-recruit on npc death causing an exception
- Fix a nullref in an edge case for loading miner jobs
- Fix chatbox not clearing itself properly on closing
- Removed loading hint about holding ctrl while recruiting (has since been replaced with a more complex menu)
- Fix typo in "connection succesful"
- Dieing without banners would not teleport you back to the "/setspawn" position if it was changed
- Swapped cooked & raw lobster icons
- Fixed right-clicking with the banner not opening any menu (banner move / banner click / colony tab) in some cases
- Fixed a situation with siege mode being caused when a colony *can* spawn a monster, but it's blocked by other safe zones when adjusted for sunrise-time-arrival. Ignore the sunrise-time-arrival-adjustment in this case and spawn them anyway.
- fix "coffebean farmer tool" -> "coffeebean farmer tool"
- fix "chickenfarmer limits" -> "chicken farmer limits"

Fixes to 0.7.3.x features, and when some of the above fixes were introduced;

0.7.3.1 changes
- Fix clicking away items in the right-side statistics legend ending up with highlighted disabled entries
- Fix menu min/max issues when all graphs are disabled
- Fix entries that are no longer updated (say stockpile items that went to 0) staying stuck on the last sample
- Remember selected statistics items after closing

0.7.3.2 changes
- Substantial rewrite of how data is sent to the client, in order to:
-- Support mods providing data configs & graphs to the statistics menu
-- Significantly reduce network bandwith used on updating the graph - by only sending the desired time period + data type instead of literally all data every time
- Change legend to also show items outside of the current selected scale, for more consistent behaviour
- Clamp the highlighted graph so that pixels off-screen top/bottom are visible at the edge
- Renamed "calories" category to "daily calories"
- Reset search field upon closing the statistics menu
- Include highlighted disabled item in autoscale calculations
- Capitalized 'Misc causes'

0.7.3.3 changes (did reset stats from saves)
- Added total calories graphs
- Added npc count / bed count / unemployed graphs
- Separate out king's presence from misc happy

0.7.3.4
- Fixed some cases where a hover-highlight would get stuck in the statistics tab
- Fixed a 0.7.3 regression where you couldn't move items / craft when outside of a colony
- Fixed a 0.7.3 regression where the command tool would not update availability as expected when moving between colonies
- Fixed right-clicking with the banner not opening any menu (banner move / banner click / colony tab) in some cases

0.7.3.5
- Fixed a situation with siege mode being caused when a colony *can* spawn a monster, but it's blocked by other safe zones when adjusted for sunrise-time-arrival. Ignore the sunrise-time-arrival-adjustment in this case and spawn them anyway.
- fix "coffebean farmer tool" -> "coffeebean farmer tool"
- fix "chickenfarmer limits" -> "chicken farmer limits"
