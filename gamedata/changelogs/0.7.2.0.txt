0.7.2.0 (2020-02-07)

Main items:
- Big overhaul to calculating shadows & rendering of torch lights
-- Light should be able to go around corners somewhat now, greatly diminishes the need to place a lot of torches everywhere
-- Torch light is now applied less "directionally", for a more uniform appearance when applied at shallow angles
- Added a new system to calculate a sensible ambient light value based on how much sun/sky light you can see (indirectly)
- Tweaked eye adaptation, bloom, fog, skybox, sun settings, ambient lighting etc to make sense with the above changes.
- Add texture quality settings (terrain, water, npc all vary)
- Redid client chat box:
-- Use the new render method for text (no more blurry text)
-- Add the ability to scroll, and keep some history
- Added the ability to scroll to the server interface log, and keep some history there
- Include active colony name in the topleft corner stats
- Enable the player light when holding a torch or lantern

Chat commands:
- Added "/debug printblockhere", prints the block you're standing in (requires cheats on)
- Added "/debug lightcheck", which spawns all blocks with a mesh set in the area around you (requires cheats on)
- Added "/debug texturecheck" - spawns all blocks that have no mesh but have a texturemapping set around you (requires cheats on)
- Added "/debug generateiconmapping {path/to/icons} {path/to/mapping.json}" - generates a types json file filled with overrides for types where the icon file name matches an icon file in the indicated folder (requires cheats on)
- Added "/debug generateiconmapping {path/to/albedo} {path/to/emissive} {path/to/normal} {path/to/height} {path/to/result_mapping.json}" - generates a texture mapping json file filled with mappings overriding existing ones where the texture files match files in the indicated folders (requires /cheats on)
- Added "/colony printhere" - prints a list of unique colonies overlapping your position
- Added "/colony setleader {player} [colony]" - sets the player as the leader of the colony (duh)
- Added "/teleport player {name}" - teleports you to that player if found (even if offline)
- Added "/teleport spawn" - teleports you to .. spawn
- Added "/setspawn" - sets .. spawn

Misc:
- Automatically load permissiongroups.json from the selected world folder if present
- Added a per block type "lightingTransparency" setting, intended for custom meshed blocks to indicate how much lighting can pass through them
- Added a way to combine multiple light sources into one, defining a relative "start point" for each in the main light
-- Now used for the lit furnace (which had 2 seperate lights, now only 1)
- JSON files loaded with index 2147483647 are now ignored (used as a magic number to handle some error things)
- Improved error handling on missing localization files
- Updated unity to 2018.4.14f1 (from 2018.4.12f1)
- Changed torch light baking and mesh culling to use unity's job system instead of the C# thread pool or a dedicated thread
- Fix defaults for texturemapping files not correctly pointing to the error/neutral textures
- Fix mods not being shown in the server browser if they did not have a dll associated with them
- Added rotation support for sending positions to the client
- Added rotation support to spawn position setting
- Saved player rotation on exit & load it back
- Fixed trading menu breaking when making a rule with a few added zeroes to the standard billion item limit
- Vary chatbox transparency based on how it's opened
- Changed mouseover audio effect
- Fixed server UI (exit to desktop, stats etc) not appearing if the server is launched via the commandline with a world arg (but without -batchmode -nographics)
- Added a key shortcut to "/" to open the chatbox with a / in it
- Don't rebroadcast unknown commands as chat
- Fix handling of external fullscreen mode changes from pushing alt + enter
- Change topleft/topright corner stats to use the new font system
- Remove that chat messages indicating active colony changes
