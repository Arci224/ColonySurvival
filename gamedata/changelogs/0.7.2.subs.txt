0.7.2.1

- Fix handheld lantern colors not matching the actual lantern color
- Reset torch color when switching away from lanterns

0.7.2.2
- Fix a bug in the torch/lantern lighting that caused some minor glitches;
-- A minor "halo" effect around the outside edges of blocks
-- In some directions the lighting would be a bit darker than others
-- Minor offset of the "ambient occlusion" style effect, got stronger the further away from the source.

0.7.2.3
- Change the personal torch to use the same system as stationary torches
- Show personal torch use on other players
- Add a toggle to enable the "dev features" (mostly camera controls in the F2-F10 range), previously already available by manually flipping a true/false in a json file
- Added F2 key to open a client overlay with the client log file, (and server one if singleplayer), should help debugging in singleplayer without manually opening a server or checking files
- Fix keymapping menu not allowing returning a key to it's original value
