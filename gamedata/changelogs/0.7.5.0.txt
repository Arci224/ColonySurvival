0.7.5 (2020-**-**)

- The game simulation now pauses when in the escape menu, when no one is connected and while the server is still loading areas on startup
- The game simulation will now slow down when the server is overloaded, instead of mostly grinding to a halt

- Added config values for server framerate and maximum simulation time per frame (gamedata/settings/server.json)
