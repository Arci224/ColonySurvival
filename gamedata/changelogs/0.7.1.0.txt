0.7.1.6 (2019-12-06)

- Added support for the steam workshop with mods and savegames
- Added per-world mod toggling support
- Added a way to start new worlds based on a workshop world
- Added a builtin mod for very flat worlds

Modding/misc things
- Reworked texture/audio downloading & caching from the server on the client
-- Doesn't create a ton of files anymore
-- Properly deduplicates files between servers and references now
-- Doesn't require the server to read all files entirely every launch anymore
-- Supports streaming the ambient audio files instead of keeping them entirely loaded
- Only supports .ogg now for audio
- FileTable related changes:
-- Changed to be an instance on ServerManager instead of a static class
-- FileTable.Register is now mostly ServerManager.FileTable.StartLoading(...)
-- Removed "monster texture" file types, merged into the npc file types
- ColonyTrading changes
-- Merged the semi-seperate ScienceAgreements into the trading IRule interface, removing a whole bunch of duplicate code
-- Added IRule.CanBeAddedTo (trader) - intended to allow science agreements to check for duplicates before being added
-- Changed IRule.ToJSON() to allow more freedom in save format
- Merged "BaseGame" mod into the server dll (mostly to the Jobs.Implementations namespace)
- Moved colonyserverrcon source project to gamedata/help (out of the mods folder)
- Delayed loading of mods till after a world is selected
- Removed AfterStartup modcallback (since loading is now delayed)
- Removed "override*Folder" variants of modinfo entries (there's specific ones for each now)
- Merged the base game from various parts into one modinfo.json entry
- Fixed addOrReplaceAudioAmbient jsonFiles entries not actually succesfully overriding ambient audio
- Changed terrain generator initialization to be inside of OnLoadingTerrainGenerator so you can put a callback before it to alter settings
- Minor pass of client UI for more consistent buttons (prefab-ized a lot of them)
- Update unity from 2018.4.5f1 to 2018.4.12f1
- Added a callback for the creation of the diplomacy menu for editing

Bug fixes vs 0.7.0
- Fixed cache file corruption if a loading screen was cancelled while a file was partially downloaded
- Fixed some possible bugs related to duplicate rule IDs between trades
- Fixed the "server already running" detection not working as intended
- Fixed a bug with the client not sending the disconnect message in singleplayer upon quitting, causing the server to hang around for a while (or until you quit the client)
