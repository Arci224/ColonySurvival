0.8.1.0 (2020-12-28)

Added the "manage jobs" menu to the colony tab, where you can select how many jobs should be enabled per job type
Should help significantly with shifting job priorities due to changing circumstances

- Laborers now take a job of the type with least current employment, instead of either order of placement or semi-random ones
- Rebalanced some luxury items so more can be produced before you hit the "maximum" that can be distributed per day
- Removed npc's refunding their job 'tool' on death

- Refresh the state of the upgrades tab every 10 secs when it's opened (so things unlock as points are received)
- Moved trash icon away from the hotbar to be attached to the stockpile menu instead
- Add bread & breadmeal as visible unlocks from the bread science
- Added setting to gamedata/settings/server.json to disable server pausing
- Fix flax farmer tooltip in the command tool menu being fish farmer related
- Fix world converter not working when the world has no 'permissionusers.json' file
- Made the upgrades table a bit bigger to fit 1 more element before scrolling
- Fix hide-all not working for the 'colony' and 'idle-job-time' data types in the statistics tab
- Fix colonists going to the closest-by-banner of *any* colony for 'idling' and for grocery/crate fallback visits instead of just their own colony
- Change the item refund from when a type is auto-removed by removing a solid block below it (while it needs a solid block base) to go to the active colony of the player, or the request origin colony, instead of to the nearest banners' colony
- Fix health not properly loading when it's saved at the max when it's upgraded
- Stop limits popup appearing while trying to use the command tool on the related blocks
- Fix tooltips not working in other menu's when there's items being dragged in the stockpile
- Fix the chatbox in some situations cutting off 1-2 letters at the end (was not properly adding a second line in some situations due to using the wrong width)
- Fix lighting flickering while simulation is paused (happens during initial loading of the world)
- Fix 'pause mode' getting stuck on when a player disconnected from a server and reconnected (would be fixed by going into the escape menu and back)

- Fix a case where the "npc path debug" tool would point to 0,0,0 instead of the intended goal
- Fix error logged when opening the world converter menu (no impact)
- Disabled kerning everywhere when ru-RU locale is selected, it is adding unexpected newlines when enabled
- Added an additional system font to the config list, to better support Thai localization
- Updated Unity3D 2019 LTS version
- Generate a random seed if none is provided via the JSON-config launch option
- Automatically fall back to loading a world if the world passed via JSON-config launch exists
- Enable "Stop NaN propagation" on the camera to hopefully fix a rare case where (presumably) torch updates cause large flashes of brightness
- Added support for sliders to the networked-UI system
- Added "colony survival/steamapps/workshop/content/366090/" as a server path that mods are searched in by default - it's the path steamCMD ends up downloading mods to with forced install dir
- Added "../../workshop/content/366090/" as a server path that mods are searched in by default - it's the default relative path for a default steam / library situation
- Recreate gamedata/mods/ folder if it disappeared (delete all & verify integrity seems to not create empty folders)
- Fix chunks with crops being instantly marked for saving on load
- Added a 2-frame delay to mouse aim working after locking the cursor to the center, hopefully works around an issue where the cursor returning to the center was recorded as mouse movement

0.8.1.3
- Potential improvement on the issue from 0.8.1.2

- Fix input fields in the content manager not masking out text that scrolls outside their area
- Fix editing trade rules from a colony that isn't your active colony showing the same colony name twice

- Fix NPC death not properly triggering an update to some of the shown stats (like the unemployed counter)
- Fix an exception in the world converter related to buttons not working

- Fix job finder not taking into account job item requirements (like bows for bow guards) when jobs are assigned anywhere but on first placement or loading
- Fix laborers not showing what item they're missing if they fail to take a job due to missing items (in addition to the bug listed a line above)
- Updated es-ES & pt-BR locales (thanks for submitting)
