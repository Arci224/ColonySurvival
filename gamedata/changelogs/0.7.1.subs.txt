0.7.1.7

- Fix co-op menu not working if you have changed mods that require confirmation
- Fix a loading issue that happens when you returning from the host settings menu / mod-update prompt
- Change the browse workshop button to go to the workshop home page instead of the items page
- Fix my subscriptions button to actually go there properly
- Fix typo in "subcribed items"
- Fix a loading issue happening due to a missing gamedata/cache/ folder

0.7.1.8

- Fix default settings being day monster medium / night monsters off
- Fix scenario description not scaling with the amount of text

0.7.1.9

- Fix co-op worlds started from a workshop world ending up being marked as singleplayer worlds
-- To workaround this for existing worlds, open "settings_readonly.json" from the save folder with some text editor;
-- Replace the bit that says "WorldType":1 with "WorldType":2 leaving the rest as-is
-- Then it should be loadable in co-op again
- Fix a case where some terrain bits would end up in the wrong place upon exiting to main menu, causing purple ghost terrain to stay until restarted
- Fix the game freezing on load if you have a very large player position (there's still plenty of other problems at a X of 2 billion though)
