0.9.0

TODO: hasn't been updated for months

- Changed crafting jobs to support longer crafting times (support going to bed halfway and such)
- Changed crafting jobs to support per-recipe crafting times, instead of per-job-type times
- Changed crafting 'limit groups' to be a fixed 1-5 choice, and they're per job type now instead of 'global'
- Added "tools" system to crafting jobs; consuming items to speed up or do work
- Workers visit a "toolshop" to restock on tools when running out
- Reworked/redid/rebalanced most content in the game
- Many new models, icons, textures and such
- Added a "day X" time tracker to each colony
- Added a "point shop" where you can trade produced items for points and buy others
- Scientist is gone, science just requires the conditions to be completable (items in stockpile, points available) and then pushing 'complete' which consumes the items
- Difficulty level now scales with science unlocked and placement of some block types as well as colonist count
- Removed point gain from 'luxury item distribution' and meal distribution
- The "NPC Shop" meal distribution block isn't a job anymore
- Monsters now keep existing when reloading/restarting the game
- Added "traps", blocks that function as a limited guard and require reloading during the day from a nearby worker
- Added support for traps/guards to slow monsters down after hitting them
- Added statistics for production/consumption
- Accessing the statistics now requires clicking on a physical block, removed the tab from the UI
- Added "outposts"; extra colonies that share stockpile/science/monsterthreat, but have separate jobs/beds/colonists/crates/safe-zone and such
- Removed "far away biome content" (tropics and such)
- Removed the menu allowing foods to be removed from distribution
- Changed most of the jobs that had the "normally invisible square" job block to have an actual mesh as a job block (moving those out of the command tool)
- Added "elevators", a way to move up/down vertically more easily. Not used by colonists
- Changed gliders to not be powered anymore; if you want to extend flight range, build outposts with elevators
- Added people-mover-rails, a way to move horizontally more easily, at the cost of requiring a fixed line of rails
- Stopped NPCs from walking over a variety of meshed blocks that are not really walkable
- Merged singleplayer/co-op menu's into one new world / load world menu
- Added a "continue" button to the main menu, it loads the same world last used
- Added a somewhat lower quality torch rendering setting; halfs torch performance impact
- Added a toggle to lock difficulty on world creation
- Added placable lockboxes to replace the point capacity upgrade

DONE INTERNAL
- Replaced save format with a SQLite database (scales better, fixes some edge cases, helps prepare for cloud saving)
- Redid multithreading (better scaling with more colonists / CPU cores; much safer/simpler code than before; less RAM use than before)
- Updated Unity from 2019 LTS to 2021 LTS
- Adjusted some network packet formats to reduce bandwidth requirements
- Moved a bunch of hardcoded / separate file configs into the main jsons via "attachBehaviour" nodes on types
- Redid NPC rendering, to allow for more animations & different NPC types more easily
- A massive heap of misc things supporting visible things above
