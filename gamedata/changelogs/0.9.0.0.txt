0.9.0 (2022-12-21)

This could've been Colony Survival 2.
Vast areas of the game have seen overhauls, improvements, changes, etc.
Unfortunately it is such a big change that old worlds (0.8.1 and before) can't be loaded.
If you wish to continue using your existing/older world, please go to the games' properties in steam and select '0.8.1' branch in the 'Beta' menu there.

A few of the main features/changes:
- Outposts; extra colonies that are still coupled to your main colony for various mechanics, allowing much easier expansion without starting over. Somewhere inbetween adding extra banners and extra colonies. Core feature of the update.
- Content; added a large amount of mechanics, jobs, items, recipes and science things to discover (in turn, most of the old other-biomes content is gone)
- New world generation; biomes with required resources are now closer, but randomized instead of in defined directions.
- Points system revamp; now the main system does not automatically consume goods anymore, but requires manual selling and allows buying certain resources as well
- Science; the scientist is gone, you have to complete them yourself now.
- Monster scaling; monster scaling now scales with placement of various blocks and completed science, more so than with colonist count
- Crafting; recipes can now take much longer, each recipe has it's own crafting time
- Traps; blocks that sort of act like fixed angle guards, and require reloading during the day by the 'trapfixer'
- Job block visuals; most job blocks now have meshes instead of textures
- Glider changes; the glider does not have an engine anymore - it glides. In return it is a fixed block 'launcher' where you can spawn as many as you want, you don't have to take it with you.
- Transport; there's also 2 types of elevator now (not used by colonists)
- Physical interface; multiple mechanics are now bound to physical blocks instead of a big overview menu
- Performance; multiple large overhauls to various ingame systems, that should in total give a boost in performance. (A torch quality settings, better NPC rendering, better multithreading, etc)
- Statistics; much asked for, production/consumption statistics
- Roaming jobs; a new type of job that searches for work near their job position, like the trapfixer that looks for nearby traps to reload
- Monster meshes; dedicated mesh per monster type, instead of a shirt recolor
- Failsafe; a long-cooldown panic button block, with costs associated to it

There's many more, smaller, supporting features and changes. Including various fixes to long-standing issues that required internal reworks to fix.
Finding out what these are is left as an exercise to the reader.
